1. Switch to the Magento User
As per the assessment requirements, the files must be owned by test-ssh. We will now switch to that user and move to the web directory.

Bash

# Switch from root to the test-ssh user
su - test-ssh

# Navigate to the Magento directory we prepared earlier
cd /var/www/html/magento


The "No such file or directory" error indicates that the directory /var/www/html/magento was never created, or was created with a typo. Since you are currently logged in as test-ssh, you do not have permission to create folders inside /var/www/html.

You need to exit back to the root user to create the directory and set the correct permissions.

1. Create the Directory as Root
Run these commands exactly:

Bash

# Exit back to root
exit

# Create the directory path
mkdir -p /var/www/html/magento

# Set the ownership to the user and group required by the assessment
chown -R test-ssh:clp /var/www/html/magento

# Set permissions so the user can write to it
chmod 775 /var/www/html/magento
2. Switch Back and Verify
Now that the folder exists and is owned by test-ssh, switch back and try again:

Bash

su - test-ssh
cd /var/www/html/magento
ls -la
3. Start the Magento Download
If the ls -la command now shows an empty directory without errors, you are ready to start the download. You will need your Adobe/Magento Marketplace Public and Private keys now.

Bash

composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-community-edition .


Start installation by following command


# Switch back to the Magento user
su - test-ssh
cd /var/www/html/magento

# Run the installer
